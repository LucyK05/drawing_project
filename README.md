# Drawing App Information

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to provide the user with a digital canvas to create custom notes, save their art online, or any other creative applications.

## Functions
**Dashboard** - The dashboard welcomes the user and explains the layout to reduce any confusion <br>
**Canvas Tab** - The canvas allows the user to pick their desired color and line thickness and draw with their mouse by holding left-click <br>
**Save/Clear Buttons** - When done, the user can choose to clear the canvas or save their drawing to the gallery tab <br>
**Gallery Tab** - The gallery tab showcases every saved drawing from the user in one easy-to-navigate place <br>
**Delete Button** - The user can choose to delete any saved drawing in the gallery using the provided delete button <br>

## AI Use
The code for the drawing app was built using Grok generative AI. The AI wrote the multiple html files in the templates folder as well as app.py file. I provided multiple prompts to restructure the canvas and gallery layout as well as fix any bugs with the save and delete functions.
